# Material Dialer-style Static UI

A static Material Web dialer-style interface for shared hosting.

## Files

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `main.js`

## What's included

- Automatic black/white theme based on device color-scheme setting
- Wider app layout for desktop preview
- Sticky search field (desktop fixed at top; mobile-only: bottom docked, moves to top on focus)
- Contacts rendered dynamically from API JSON
- Displays contact logo, name, phone number, and paid phone (if present)
- Full-row tap/click to dial via `tel:` links
- Ripple feedback on row click/tap
- Removed default mobile tap highlight flash on contact row links
- Client-side search filtering in plain JavaScript

## API source

The app fetches contacts from:

`https://admin.0700bezplatnite.com/0700backend/contact/getIOSContacts`

The renderer is tolerant to common key variations (`name`, `phone`, `paidPhone`, `logo`, etc.).

The client now uses a permissive `Accept: */*` request header to mirror the successful mobile/browser request profile.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

## Deploy

Upload all files to your hosting public directory (for example `public_html/`).

## Open directly from file system

You can open `index.html` directly (double-click). `main.js` is a deferred classic script for `file://` compatibility.

> Note: Material Web and Google Fonts are loaded from CDNs, so client browsers need internet access to those domains.

## Important: `charset` in **response** headers

If DevTools still shows `Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1`, that header is generated by the **backend server** and cannot be removed from frontend JavaScript.

To remove it, update backend/server config (Apache examples):

```apache
AddDefaultCharset Off

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header always set Content-Type "application/json"
</IfModule>
```

Or in app code, set response content type explicitly to `application/json` without a charset suffix.
